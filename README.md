# Combustion Cats

In-terminal implementation of the Exploding Kittens card game in OCaml. The objective of the game is to avoid drawing an “exploding kitten” card from the deck, which “kills” the player, thus rendering them out of the game. Players can use cards such as “skip” or “draw from bottom” to avoid drawing an “exploding kitten” card.
